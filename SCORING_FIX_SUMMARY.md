# üéØ CRITICAL SCORING FIX - Numerical Contradictions

## ‚ùå Problem Identified

The user identified a critical flaw in the authenticity scoring algorithm:

**Original Issue:**
```json
{
  "claim": "MILLS CHODY LLP has SRA number 48778",
  "authenticity_score": 0.6018333333333333,
  "authenticity_level": "likely_true",
  "evidence_count": 1,
  "contradictions_count": 1,
  "contradictions": [
    {
      "sentence": "SRA ID: 487179 | SRA Regulated",
      "contradiction_type": "numerical_contradiction"
    }
  ]
}
```

**The Problem:** Despite finding a numerical contradiction showing "SRA ID: 487179" when the claim states "48778", the system still rated it as "likely_true" (0.60 score). This is completely incorrect - numerical contradictions should severely impact authenticity.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Evidence Quality Scoring**
Added severe penalties for different types of contradictions:

```python
# **CRITICAL FIX**: Numerical contradictions should have severe penalty
contradiction_type = contra.get('contradiction_type', '')
if contradiction_type == 'numerical_contradiction':
    # Numerical contradictions (like wrong ID numbers) are highly damaging
    base_penalty *= 3.0  # Triple the penalty for numerical contradictions
elif contradiction_type == 'regulatory_contradiction':
    # Regulatory contradictions are also serious
    base_penalty *= 2.5
elif contradiction_type == 'direct_negation':
    # Direct negations are serious
    base_penalty *= 2.0
```

### 2. **Final Score Penalty for Numerical Contradictions**
Added additional penalty at the final score level:

```python
# **CRITICAL FIX**: Apply severe penalty for numerical contradictions
numerical_contradiction_penalty = 0.0
for contra in contradictions:
    if contra.get('contradiction_type') == 'numerical_contradiction':
        # Numerical contradictions (wrong IDs, numbers) should severely impact score
        source_credibility = contra.get('source_credibility', 0.5)
        numerical_contradiction_penalty += 0.4 * source_credibility

# Apply the numerical contradiction penalty
final_score -= numerical_contradiction_penalty

# For numerical contradictions, cap the maximum score to "uncertain" level
if numerical_contradiction_penalty > 0:
    final_score = min(final_score, 0.55)  # Cap at upper "uncertain" range
```

### 3. **Enhanced Explanation Generation**
Updated explanations to highlight numerical contradictions:

```python
if numerical_contradictions:
    # Highlight numerical contradictions as they're very serious
    explanations.append(f"CRITICAL: Found {len(numerical_contradictions)} numerical contradiction(s) with specific numbers/IDs that don't match the claim.")
    if evidence:
        explanations.append(f"Despite {len(evidence)} supporting evidence items, the numerical contradictions significantly impact authenticity.")
```

## üìä Test Results - Before vs After

### Before Fix:
```
Claim: "MILLS CHODY LLP has SRA number 48778"
Evidence: SRA ID: 487179 (contradicts 48778)
Score: 0.602
Level: "likely_true" ‚ùå WRONG
```

### After Fix:
```
Claim: "MILLS CHODY LLP has SRA number 48778"  
Evidence: SRA ID: 487179 (contradicts 48778)
Score: 0.065
Level: "false" ‚úÖ CORRECT
Explanation: "CRITICAL: Found 1 numerical contradiction(s) with specific numbers/IDs that don't match the claim."
```

## üîç Verification Results

```
üß™ TESTING NUMERICAL CONTRADICTION SCORING
============================================================
üìä Test Results:
Claim: MILLS CHODY LLP has SRA number 48778
Final Score: 0.065
Authenticity Level: false
Explanation: This claim is highly likely to be false. Based on 1 sources of varying credibility. CRITICAL: Found 1 numerical contradiction(s) with specific numbers/IDs that don't match the claim. Despite 1 supporting evidence items, the numerical contradictions significantly impact authenticity.

üîç VERIFICATION:
Numerical contradiction score: 0.065 (false)
Regular contradiction score: 0.299 (likely_false)
‚úÖ PASS: Numerical contradictions properly penalized
‚úÖ PASS: Numerical contradiction correctly classified as uncertain or worse
‚úÖ PASS: Explanation properly highlights numerical contradiction
```

## üéØ Key Improvements

### 1. **Proper Severity Handling**
- **Numerical contradictions**: 3x penalty multiplier + additional 0.4 final score penalty
- **Regulatory contradictions**: 2.5x penalty multiplier  
- **Direct negations**: 2x penalty multiplier
- **General contradictions**: Standard penalty

### 2. **Score Capping**
- Claims with numerical contradictions are capped at max 0.55 score ("uncertain" level)
- Prevents false "likely_true" or "verified" ratings when numbers don't match

### 3. **Clear Explanations**
- Explanations now explicitly mention "CRITICAL" for numerical contradictions
- Users understand why the score is low despite some supporting evidence

### 4. **Contextual Accuracy**
- Wrong ID numbers, registration numbers, dates, amounts now properly flagged
- System correctly identifies when specific numerical claims are contradicted by evidence

## üöÄ Impact

This fix ensures that:

1. **Numerical contradictions** (like wrong SRA numbers, incorrect amounts, wrong dates) are treated as severe authenticity issues
2. **Scores reflect reality** - claims with factual numerical errors get low authenticity scores
3. **Users get clear explanations** about why scores are low when numbers don't match
4. **System maintains credibility** by not rating obviously incorrect numerical claims as "likely_true"

The fact-checking system now correctly handles one of the most critical types of misinformation: **specific factual inaccuracies in numbers, IDs, and quantitative claims**.

## ‚úÖ Status: **FIXED AND VERIFIED**

All tests pass and the system now correctly identifies numerical contradictions as severe authenticity issues, preventing false positive ratings for claims with incorrect numbers.
