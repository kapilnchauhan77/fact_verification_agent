    The World Health Organization announced in March 2023 that COVID-19 vaccines have prevented 
    approximately 20 million deaths globally. Meanwhile, Apple's market capitalization reached 
    $3 trillion for the first time in January 2022, making it the most valuable company in history.
    
    A breakthrough study published in Science magazine found that CRISPR gene editing technology 
    can cure sickle cell disease with 95% success rate. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates 
    by 0.75% in September 2022, the largest single increase since 1994.
    
    Researchers at MIT developed a new quantum computer that operates at room temperature, 
    potentially revolutionizing computing. Tesla's stock price dropped 65% in 2022 following 
    Elon Musk's Twitter acquisition for $44 billion.
