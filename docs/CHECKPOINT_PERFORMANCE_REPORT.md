**Key Insights:**
- Scientific claims take 2.2x longer due to academic source complexity
- Medical claims benefit from authoritative sources (WHO, CDC)
- Financial claims affected by paywall restrictions
- Statistical claims fastest due to government data availability

## 🚨 Critical Bottlenecks & Solutions

### **1. Web Search Execution (9.46s avg)**
**Problem:** External search API latency and rate limits
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Implement Redis caching for search results
- ✅ Use concurrent search across multiple engines
- ✅ Reduce from 3 to 2 search queries per claim
- ✅ Pre-warm cache with common query patterns

### **2. Source Search Overall (12.34s avg)**
**Problem:** Sequential processing of source discovery
**Solutions:**  
- ✅ Priority source checking (check reuters.com, who.int first)
- ✅ Parallel source validation
- ✅ Smart query generation based on claim type
- ✅ Domain-specific search strategies

### **3. Content Extraction Failures (40% newspaper3k fails)**
**Problem:** 403 errors from blocked domains
**Solutions:**
- ✅ Enhanced domain blocking (16 blocked domains)
- ✅ User agent rotation (5 different browsers)
- ✅ Improved fallback chain efficiency
- ✅ Proxy rotation for persistent blocking
